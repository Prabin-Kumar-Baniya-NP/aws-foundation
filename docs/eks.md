# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

![Amazon EKS](./images/eks.png)

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. 

- It is certified Kubernetes conformant, so existing applications that run on upstream Kubernetes are compatible with Amazon EKS.

- Amazon EKS automatically manages the availability and scalability of the cluster nodes that are responsible for starting and stopping containers, scheduling containers on virtual machines, storing cluster data, and other tasks. 

- It automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes for each cluster. 

- You can take advantage of the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of the AWS Cloud, which includes AWS networking and security services like Application Load Balancers for load distribution, IAM for role-based access control, and VPC for
pod networking.
