- AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision
  your resources following AWS best practices.

- AWS Trusted Advisor looks at your entire AWS environment and gives you recommendations in five categories:

### 1. Cost Optimization

- AWS Trusted Advisor looks at your resource use and makes recommendations to help you optimize cost by eliminating unused and idle resources, or by making commitments to reserved capacity.

### 2. Performance

- Improve the performance of your service by checking your service limits, ensuring you take advantage of provisioned throughput, and monitoring for overutilized instances.

### 3. Security

- Improve the security of your application by closing gaps, enabling various AWS security features, and examining your permissions.

### 4. Fault Tolerance

- Increase the availability and redundancy of your AWS application by taking advantage of automatic scaling, health checks, Multi-AZ deployments, and backup capabilities.

### 5. Service Limits

- AWS Trusted Advisor checks for service usage that is more than 80 percent of the service limit. Values are based on a snapshot, so your current usage might differ.
- Limit and usage data can take up to 24 hours to reflect any changes.
