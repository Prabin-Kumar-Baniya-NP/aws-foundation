# AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- It is a platform as a service (PaaS) that facilitates the quick deployment, scaling, and management of your web applications
and services.

- The entire platform is already built, and you only need to upload your code. Choose your instance type, your database, set and adjust automatic scaling, update your application, access the server log files, and enable HTTPS on the load balancer.

- You upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning and load balancing to automatic scaling and monitoring application health. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources that power your application, and you can access the underlying resources at any time.

- Elastic Beanstalk supports a broad range of platforms. Supported platforms include Docker, Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

- There is no additional charge for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You pay for the AWS resources (for example, EC2 instances or S3 buckets) you create to store and run your application.
