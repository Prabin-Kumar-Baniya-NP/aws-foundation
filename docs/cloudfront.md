# AWS CloudFront

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

- It is a globally distributed system of caching servers.

- It caches copies of commonly requested files (static content).

- Delivers a local copy of the requested content from a nearby cache edge or Point of Presence.

- It accelerates delivery of dynamic content.

- It improves application performance and scaling.

### Amazon CloudFront

- It is a fast, global, and secure CDN service.

- It has global network of edge locations and regional edge caches.

- Amazon CloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers that are called edge locations.

- When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency.

- As objects become less popular, individual edge locations might remove those objects to make room for more popular content.

- For the less popular content, CloudFront has Regional edge caches. Regional edge caches are CloudFront locations that are deployed globally and are close to the viewers. They are located between your origin server and the global edge locations that serve content directly to viewers.

- A Regional edge cache has a larger cache than an individual edge location, so objects remain in the Regional edge cache longer.
