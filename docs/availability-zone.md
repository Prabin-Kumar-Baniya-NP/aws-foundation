# AWS Availablity Zone

- Each AWS region has one or more availability zone.

- Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of AWS infrastructure.

- Each Availability Zone consists of one or more data centers.

- They are designed for fault isolation.

- AWS recommends replicating data and resources across availability zone for resiliency.
