- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

- It is integrated with Amazon ECS, so you can store, run, and manage container images for applications that run on Amazon ECS.

- Specify the Amazon ECR repository in your task definition, and Amazon ECS will retrieve the appropriate images for your applications.
